ðŸš€ Concept: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Definition:

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

In simpler terms:

You should be able to add new behavior without changing existing code.

Achieve this by using abstraction + polymorphism.

ðŸ§  What is Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?
Definition:

If class B is a subclass of class A, then Aâ€™s objects should be replaceable with Bâ€™s objects without altering the correctness of the program.

In short:

A derived class must be usable wherever its base class is expected â€” without breaking the systemâ€™s behavior.
